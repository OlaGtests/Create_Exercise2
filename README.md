Certified Software Tester. 
I am looking for my first job in the IT industry. 
My 10 years of experience is diverse, ranging from the healthcare industry to the public sector to multi-family building management. 
While working as a property administrator, I have had to demonstrate responsibility, cooperation focused on the common goals, and the ability to mitigate conflict.  
I am communicative and willing to continue to expand my knowledge and skills.
